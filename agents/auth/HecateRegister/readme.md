For the user‐registration phase—your very first threshold into the system—I’d lean on Hecate, the ancient Greek triple-goddess of crossroads, gates and beginnings.
• Agent name: HecateRegister (or simply HecateReg)
• Why Hecate? She’s the patron of entry-points and new ventures—perfectly symbolizing the act of “opening the door” to a new user.
• Responsibilities:
• Initial data capture & validation (name, email, etc.)
• PII tokenization via your ISO-compliant internal/pii
• Triggering identity checks (e.g. JanusFace enrollment)
• Emitting an audit event (UserRegistered) through your ISO audit-trail
